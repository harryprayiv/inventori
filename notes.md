Me: I want to create a simple app that actually just loads my web app.  Is that possible to do without having a run a server that the iphone would talk to?  

Yes, you can create a simple web app that runs on an iPhone without requiring a server. A Progressive Web App (PWA) is a type of web application that can be installed and run offline on a user's device. It can be used on both Android and iOS devices and provides a native app-like experience.

To create a PWA, follow these steps:

1. **Create a manifest file**: Create a file named `manifest.json` and place it in the root of your project. This file contains metadata about your app, such as its name, icons, and start URL. Here's a simple example:

```json
{
  "name": "My Web App",
  "short_name": "WebApp",
  "description": "A simple web app",
  "start_url": "index.html",
  "display": "standalone",
  "background_color": "#ffffff",
  "theme_color": "#000000",
  "icons": [
    {
      "src": "icon-192x192.png",
      "sizes": "192x192",
      "type": "image/png"
    },
    {
      "src": "icon-512x512.png",
      "sizes": "512x512",
      "type": "image/png"
    }
  ]
}
```

2. **Link the manifest file**: Add a link to the `manifest.json` file in your `index.html` file's `<head>` section:

```html
<link rel="manifest" href="manifest.json">
```

3. **Create a service worker**: A service worker is a JavaScript file that runs in the background and enables caching and offline functionality. Create a `service-worker.js` file in the root of your project and add the following code:

```javascript
self.addEventListener('install', (event) => {
  event.waitUntil(
    caches.open('my-cache').then((cache) => {
      return cache.addAll([
        '/',
        '/index.html',
        '/styles.css',
        '/main.js',
        '/icon-192x192.png',
        '/icon-512x512.png',
      ]);
    })
  );
});

self.addEventListener('fetch', (event) => {
  event.respondWith(
    caches.match(event.request).then((response) => {
      return response || fetch(event.request);
    })
  );
});
```

4. **Register the service worker**: In your `index.html` or `main.js` file, add the following code to register the service worker:

```javascript
if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
  window.addEventListener('load', () => {
    navigator.serviceWorker
      .register('/service-worker.js')
      .then((registration) => {
        console.log('Service Worker registered: ', registration);
      })
      .catch((error) => {
        console.log('Service Worker registration failed: ', error);
      });
  });
}
```

After completing these steps, your web app should be installable as a PWA on an iPhone. When a user visits your web app in Safari, they can add it to their home screen, which will install the PWA on their device. The app will be available offline and will run without requiring a server.

However, please note that some features and APIs might not be available in a PWA compared to a native app. If you need access to specific native features, you might want to consider building a hybrid app using a framework like React Native, Ionic, or Flutter.



Me: what I mean is how do I submit an app to the app store that is merely just a wrapper around this web app.  Just as you said, I want to be able to run the web app on the user's phone even without an internet connection.

If you want to create a native app wrapper for your web app to submit it to the App Store, you can use a WebView component in a native iOS app. WebView can display your web app, and with a PWA configured correctly, it will work offline.

Here's a simple process to create an iOS app using Swift and WKWebView:

1. **Create a new iOS project**: Open Xcode and create a new project using the "Single View App" template. Name your project and set the language to Swift.

2. **Add the web app files**: Copy your web app files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.) into the project folder. In Xcode, right-click on the project folder in the "Project Navigator" and select "Add Files to [Your Project Name]". Select the web app files and click "Add".

3. **Configure the WKWebView**: Open the `ViewController.swift` file and import the `WebKit` framework at the top of the file:

```swift
import UIKit
import WebKit
```

Replace the `UIViewController` class definition with the following:

```swift
class ViewController: UIViewController, WKNavigationDelegate {
    var webView: WKWebView!

    override func loadView() {
        webView = WKWebView()
        webView.navigationDelegate = self
        view = webView
    }

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()

        // Load your web app from the local files
        if let url = Bundle.main.url(forResource: "index", withExtension: "html") {
            webView.loadFileURL(url, allowingReadAccessTo: url.deletingLastPathComponent())
        }
    }
}
```

This code sets up a WKWebView, loads the `index.html` file, and allows the WebView to access other files in the same folder.

4. **Enable App Transport Security**: By default, iOS apps block loading resources over HTTP. Since your web app is running on the device, you need to allow it to load local files. Open the `Info.plist` file, right-click on an empty space, and select "Add Row". Add a new key called "App Transport Security Settings" with the type "Dictionary". Expand the new dictionary, add a new key called "Allow Arbitrary Loads" with the type "Boolean", and set its value to "YES".

5. **Configure PWA caching**: Make sure your web app is set up as a PWA with proper caching using a manifest file and service worker as described in the previous answer.

6. **Test your app**: Run your app on an iOS simulator or a physical device. Your web app should load and work offline.

Once you've completed these steps, you'll have an iOS app that wraps your web app and can be submitted to the App Store. However, be aware that Apple's App Store guidelines may not allow apps that are just simple WebView wrappers with limited functionality. Make sure your app complies with the guidelines before submitting it to the App Store.
